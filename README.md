# BÃ³kun Inventory Service Plugin â€“ Skeleton Implementation

This repository provides a skeleton implementation of a **BÃ³kun Inventory Service plugin** in Java.

It serves as a solid starting point for developers aiming to implement their own inventory service plugin using BÃ³kun's gRPC-based plugin infrastructure.

> ðŸ”§ **Included Implementation:** This skeleton has been extended with a working example â€“ the **Vistra Inventory Plugin**, a BÃ³kun-to-BÃ³kun plugin that demonstrates how to proxy inventory data between two BÃ³kun accounts.

## âœ… Features

* Base structure for implementing BÃ³kun Inventory Service plugins.
* Pre-configured with required dependencies for gRPC and protocol buffer integration.
* Built in Java 8.

## ðŸ“š Documentation

Before diving in, please [read the official documentation](https://bokun.dev/implementing-inventory-service-plugin/rGmzgGe66zjtEQ8FUvS8dd/overview/ngZRtjHXMewiomPfARFDfZ) to understand the plugin interface and lifecycle.

## ðŸ”Œ Vistra Inventory Plugin

This repository now includes the **Vistra Inventory Plugin** â€“ a working example of a **BÃ³kun to BÃ³kun plugin** that connects two separate BÃ³kun instances.

It illustrates how to:

* Fetch products and inventory from a source BÃ³kun account.
* Serve those as available inventory to a target account.
* Handle availability checks and booking ID mapping across systems.

## ðŸ§° Requirements

* Java 8
* Maven or Gradle (for building the project)
